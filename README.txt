This repository consists of all my CS courses that I have taken at WPI which are separated into each term that I have taken them. For example, to see the projects that I completed during my software engineering class, navigate to My CS Education -> B22 -> Software Engineering. To see any design/HCI projects, navigate to "My CS Education" -> B22 -> HCI -> "Term Project" , and then click on the Youtube link to see a demo of my HCI term project. My software engineering project, Punchstarter, also shows an advanced UI with a lot of HTML styling using CSS in React.
