For Compilation: run make file

Project 4 let us implement different scheduling algorithms and learn about the pros and cons of each method.
We implemented shortest job first (SJF), first in first out (FIFO), and round robin (RR) in this program.
Our policy analysis includes response time, turnaround time, and wait time.
We have one struct named "job" that contains its id, length, wait time, turnaround time, response time, the time left, and the pointer to the next job.


One note about passing the test cases. The program does produce the correct output, however it may not pass some of the test cases due to test cases formatting.
However, all parts that are in the test cases are included in our output, proving that our code is correct.
