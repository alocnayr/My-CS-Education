Section I: section on how to compile and execute your code. Include clear easy-to-follow
step by step that TAs can follow

- Place the code in an IDE and run the main method. The program will prompt you to enter
commands corresponding to the commands listed in the assignment. You will need to include
the folder Project3Dataset-A and Project3Dataset-B outside of src.

Section II: State clearly which parts are working and which parts are not working in your
code. This will help the TAs give you fair points.

- Everything is working to my knowledge.

Section III: section describes any design decisions that you do beyond the design guidelines
given in this document

- I commented my code a lot to make everything a lot easier to understand and
I added class level comments to explain what each class does. Nothing goes beyond the
assignment. If you look at any of the code logic, in the Main class, I used shortcuts for the commands
because it was really annoying to type them all out everytime, but this is just in addition to the
commands listed in the assignment.

DatasetReader: This class is used to read the files in the specified dataset and store them in a list of records.

Record: This record is used to store the data for each record in the dataset.

HashBasedJoin: This class implements section 2. I did not sort the records in each bucket.

NestedLoopJoin: This class implements section 3.

HashBasedAggregation: This class implements section 4.

Main: This class is used to run the program and prompt the user for input.
