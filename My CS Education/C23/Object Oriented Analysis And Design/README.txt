This Software Engineering course will focus on the process of Object-Oriented Analysis and Design. Students will be expected to complete a large number of exercises in Domain Modeling, Use Case Analysis, and Object-Oriented Design. In addition, the course will investigate Design Patterns, which are elements of reusable object-oriented software designs. This course will survey a set of design patterns and consider how these patterns are described and used to solve design problems.
